# Final_Portfolio_Computational_Physics

This is a portfolio of all of the computational physics projects I completed at High Point University in the spring semester of 2022.  To begin, the first project was modelling helium atoms inside a latex balloon <

The second project I did was modelling the path of a hovercraft.  This was fun for me as I had volunteered at a science exposition for community outreach for our school, called HPUinverse day, where I gave kids rides on our makeshift hovercrafts.  It was shown that the movement of the hovercraft was dependent on its radius.  Rotational displacement and angular velocity was also calculated. <https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/01-project-Holden-Harrington.git>

The third project was about analyzing MLB home run derby hits.  The project was discovering whether or not there was an ideal launch angle to reach a maximum distance. <https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/02-project-Holden-Harrington.git>

The fourth project modelled coupled oscillators with one end free and the other end bound. <https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/03-project-Holden-Harrington.git>
