# Final_Portfolio_Computational_Physics

This is a portfolio of all of the computational physics projects I completed at High Point University in the spring semester of 2022.  To begin, the first project was modelling helium atoms inside a latex balloon <
https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/00-project-Holden-Harrington.git>.  This was challenging as I had to take into account the gaps between the latex and let helium atoms escape slowly.
