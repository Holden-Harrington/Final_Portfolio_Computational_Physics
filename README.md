This is a portfolio of all of the computational physics projects Holden Harrington completed at High Point University in the spring semester of 2022.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
* [Helium Atoms Inside a Latex Balloon](https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/00-project-Holden-Harrington.git) - To begin, the first project involved modelling helium atoms inside a latex balloon.  This was challenging as I had to take into account the gaps between the latex and let helium atoms escape slowly.

* [Path of a hovercraft](https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/01-project-Holden-Harrington.git) -  This was exciting for the student as he had volunteered at a science exposition for community outreach for their university, called HPUinverse day, where he gave kids rides on makeshift hovercrafts.  It was shown that the movement of the hovercraft was dependent on its radius.  Rotational displacement and angular velocity were also calculated.

* [MLB Home Runs](https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/02-project-Holden-Harrington.git) - The third project was about analyzing MLB home run derby hits.  The project was discovering whether or not there was an ideal launch angle to reach a maximum distance.

* [Couples Oscillators](<https://github.com/HPUPhysics-PHY2200-S22/03-project-Holden-Harrington.git>) - The fourth project modelled coupled oscillators with one end free and the other end bound.

* [Eclipsing Binary Star System](<https://github.com/Holden-Harrington/Final_Portfolio_Computational_Physics/blob/main/Final-Project-Holden_Harrington.ipynb>) - The final project consisted of modeling a light curve of an eclipsing binary star system.  The idea of the project was to simulate a star orbitting a stationary star and calculate how much area was being covered by the other star.  This was attempted through a method called tiling.  Tiling is simply breaking the object into a bunch of small boxes.  These boxes made up the star and then would need to compare the areas being covered by comparing the location of the center masses of the tiles of one star to the other.
