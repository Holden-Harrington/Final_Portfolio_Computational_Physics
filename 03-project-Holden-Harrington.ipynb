    "The Momentum Principle shows that $d\\vec{p}/dt$ is in the x-direction and is proportional to $(L_1 -L_2)$, this being the difference in the lengths of the springs. Since each ball is connected to exactly two springs, when the Momentum Principle is applied to every ball in a line of coupled oscillators, the same result will be accomplished: the rate of change of the momentum of a ball is in the x-direction and is proportional to the difference in lengths of the springs attached to the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for $d\\vec{p}/dt$, define a variable $u$ for the x-component of the position of the ball relative to its equilibrium position, so $u = x-x_{equil}$. This is the *relative position* of the ball. Once the ball is positioned to the left, $u$ is negative, the first spring has a length of $L_0 + u$, and the second one has a length of $L_0-u$. The difference in the lengths of the springs is $L_1 -L_2=2u$, and the Momentum Principle gives $dp_x/dt = -2k_su$.\n",
